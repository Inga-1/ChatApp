**Chatting App **

This has been my biggest project so far, which includes building a chatting app completely from scratch. The current version of the code includes a number of features, such as the ablity to sign up, log in, log out, view current friends, and much more!

The program includes both the backend and the front end components of the project. C# and .NET were used to develop the back end portion, Angular was used as the front end framework, while SQLite was used the database requests. 

The project is inspired by a course from Udemy.
